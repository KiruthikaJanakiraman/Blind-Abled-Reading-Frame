# Blind-Abled-Reading-Frame (BARF)
B.A.R.F is a **cognitive frame** that helps the visually impaired, with these glasses they can expand their horizon and do things that they have always wanted. B.A.R.F is very user-friendly for the blind as it gets activated on voice commands. It runs on **Raspberry Pi** and uses text and image processing to detect text, objects and currency and converts them to audio for the visually impaired person. 

Two of my college mates and I have worked on this project which was funded by my college. We are working on applying for a patent right now.
